<p>The purpose of this policy is to provide information and guidance on
activities of the unclassified staff that may give rise to the potential
 for a conflict of commitment. A conflict of commitment is a type of
conflict of interest that may occur when outside professional activities
 interfere with a university employee’s ability to fulfill university
expectations, obligations, and responsibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A</em><em>s conflicts of commitment generally involve issues of
time allocation between university and outside professional activities,
time commitments to outside professional activities are the focus of
this policy. Non-professional activities or work that is unrelated to an
 unclassified staff member’s appointment that does not interfere with
the employee's ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the
University does not need to be reported and is not the focus of this
policy.</em></li>

<dt><strong>Material conflict</strong></dt>
<dd>A material conflict is an activity or financial interest that may
align or overlap with the obligations associated with the unclassified
staff member’s appointment and their expected primary contributions to
teaching, research or other activities that advance the University’s
interests.</dd>
<dt><strong>Outside professional activities</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Outside professional activities are those related to an unclassified
staff member’s responsibilities of employment at the University that
they participate in outside of the scope of their University employment.</p>
<p>All outside professional activities are reportable using the on-line
Outside Activities Report, whether or not compensation is received.
Examples of reportable outside professional activities, which may also
represent a material conflict, include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teaching, research, or administrative activities under contract or
other form of agreement at an educational institution, organization,
government agency, foundation, or any other&nbsp; entity outside of the
University;</li>
<li>Employment outside of the University with duties related to University responsibilities;</li>
<li>Playing a role in founding a company or in a company’s ongoing operation;</li>
<li>Providing consulting services outside of the University;</li>
<li>Serving on a board of directors or in an executive or managerial
position for an entity outside of the University or for an organization
that is not directly University-related or that is not a professional
association in the unclassified staff members’ field;</li>
<li>Serving on a scientific advisory board for a company;</li>
<li>Serving as an expert witness;</li>
<li>Presenting at a symposium or workshop on behalf of a company.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Ordinary institutional activities</strong></dt>
<dd>Ordinary institutional activities include those activities which
extend an unclassified staff member’s institutional responsibilities of
teaching, research or service to other public institutions,
organizations, and professional societies. Examples of such activities
include:</dd>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Occasional lectures, colloquia, seminars, etc., given at colleges and universities and at meetings of professional societies;</li>
<li>Invited or juried installations, shows or exhibitions;</li>
<li>Musical, literary or theatrical performances;</li>
<li>Evaluation of colleagues at other colleges and universities through
participation in program evaluations and tenure and promotion reviews;</li>
<li>Preparation of monographs, chapters and editorial services for nonprofit educational organizations;</li>
<li>Service on review panels for the federal government;</li>
<li>Service on advisory committees and evaluation panels for nonprofit foundations and educational organizations;</li>
<li>Leadership positions in professional or scholarly societies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ordinary institutional activities do not themselves create a conflict
 of commitment, and do not need be reported in order to participate in
them. However, unclassified staff are expected to engage in them in a
manner that limits their impact on normal on-campus responsibilities.</p>
<p>With the single exception of service on a federal grant panel, any
compensation received from ordinary institutional activities is
reportable using the on-line Outside Activities Report.</p>

      <dt class="blacklight-scope_ss col-md-3">Scope:</dt>

<p>This policy is responsive to the definitions, requirements for
reporting of outside professional activities, standards of conduct and
other guidance provided in Chapter UWS 8, Unclassified Staff Code of
Ethics. The policy provides institutional standards concerning absence
from regular duties for the purpose of engaging in outside activities
and guidelines for identifying types or categories of outside activities
 which may result in a material conflict of interest.</p>
</div></dd>
      <dt class="blacklight-policydisplay_ss col-md-3">Policy:</dt>
      <dd class="blacklight-policydisplay_ss col-md-9"><div>
<p>UW-Madison’s expectation is that the primary professional skills,
obligations, and work effort of its employees are committed to
UW-Madison. At the time of appointment, every member of the unclassified
 staff makes a personal commitment to professional honesty and
integrity.<sup id="R1"><a href="#F1">1</a></sup> University unclassified
 staff are responsible for teaching, research or other scholarly
activity appropriate to the discipline, and service to the institution
and the public. University unclassified staff that are meeting
expectations of employment have the privilege to engage in outside
professional activities with approval and oversight. In order to ensure
that outside professional activities are conducted in a manner that does
 not conflict with an unclassified staff member’s commitment to the
University, these members must disclose outside professional activities
to the University on their Outside Activities Report. Whether commitment
 to an outside professional activity impacts university performance is
generally determined by the Dean of the unclassified staff member’s
school or college tenure home, who shall also consult with the
unclassified staff member’s department chair or supervisor, unless
circumstances warrant that such a determination be made by a Director,
the Provost or Chancellor. An unclassified staff member shall not engage
 in outside professional activities that create a conflict of
commitment.</p>
<h2>General Principles and Expectations</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Avoidance of material conflicts</h3>
<p>In any situation that a material conflict may arise between the
personal interests of an unclassified staff member and their public
responsibilities to the university, the member must notify their Dean or
 Director or their designee by submitting an Outside Activity Report
describing the nature of the possible conflict so that the circumstances
 may be evaluated, and action taken as contemplated by UWS 8.04.</p>
<p>While this policy specifies time limits below which unclassified
staff meeting university employment expectations may engage in outside
professional activities that have been reported as required by UWS 8
without seeking written pre-approval of time commitment, the
unclassified staff should be aware that the circumstances and impact of
all professional and institutional activities on an individual’s
institutional responsibilities are subject to review and approval by the
 Dean or Director or their designee.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing professional commitments—exclusion of uncompensated ordinary institutional activities from the Outside Activity Report</strong>.</p>
<p>Ordinary institutional activities, as defined above, are encouraged
by the University and do not count toward the allowable time limits for
outside activities. However, unclassified staff are expected to engage
in ordinary institutional activities in a manner that does not
negatively impact their primary responsibilities to the university. If,
in the determination of the Dean or Director or their designee, an
unclassified staff member’s commitments to ordinary institutional
activities are such that fulfillment of the primary obligation to
University teaching, research, or service is suffering, then the
unclassified staff member’s portfolio of ordinary institutional
activities and primary university responsibilities should be reviewed
and rebalanced as needed. This situation might occur when the
unclassified staff member has a full schedule of contributions to grant
review panels, work for professional societies and other professional
commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Reporting obligations</h3>
<p>All outside professional activities of the unclassified staff are
reportable, regardless of when during the year the activity occurs, and
are also subject to review, evaluation, management, and approval by the
University to ensure compliance with applicable policies and
regulations.<span id="R2" style="font-size: 9.75px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;"><a href="#F2">2</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Time limits</h3>
<p>Members of the unclassified staff may not engage in outside
professional activities without institutional assessment of how the time
 committed to these activities may impact their expected contributions
to the university. Engagement in outside professional activities must
not disrupt performance of university primary duties, including
teaching, research, service, administrative responsibilities, and
outreach.</p>
<p>The following time limitations represent the maximum number of days
an unclassified staff member may devote to outside professional
activities without prior written approval of time commitments to the
outside activity from their Dean or Director or their designee.
Individual schools, colleges, and departments may impose stricter
requirements than these time limitations reflecting local needs and
concerns.<sup id="R3"></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Annual basis appointments (A-basis).</strong> If an
unclassified staff member’s aggregate time commitment toward outside
professional activities will exceed an average of more than the
equivalent of two eight-hour days per calendar month per year,
regardless of when this occurs, the unclassified staff member must
receive prior, written permission from their Dean or Director or their
designee.</li>
<li><strong>Academic year appointments (C-basis).</strong> If an
unclassified staff member’s aggregate time commitment toward outside
professional activities will exceed an average of more than two
eight-hour days per calendar month during their contract term,
regardless of when this occurs, the unclassified staff member must
receive prior, written permission from their Dean or Director or their
designee. For outside professional activities that have been reported
and determined by the Dean or Director or their designee to not
represent a material conflict, there are no time limits for the
unclassified staff member’s engagement in outside professional
activities while not on contract to the University.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Part-time and summer appointments.</strong> If the
individual has a part-time or summer contract from the University, the
maximum number of days an unclassified staff member may engage in
outside professional activities without prior approval of their Dean or
Director or their designee is two eight-hour days per month of the
contract. The number of days allowed for outside professional activities
 for individuals with appointments less than 100 percent time shall be
prorated based on the percentage of appointment. If an unclassified
staff member’s request for aggregate time commitment toward outside
professional activities will exceed the prorated decrease in time
allowed, the unclassified staff member must receive prior, written
permission from their Dean or Director or their designee to engage in
the outside professional activity.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Carry over.</strong> Unclassified staff members are not
entitled to an allotment of time. Unused days may not be carried over to
 a new year. Furthermore, it is expected that days committed to outside
professional activities will be spread out throughout the year so as not
 to disrupt performance of other university responsibilities.<span id="R3" style="font-size: 9.75px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;"><a href="#F3">3</a></span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Absence from classes</h3>
<p>No member of the unclassified staff shall be absent from his/her
assigned classes or other regular instructional duties at the University
 except by the permission of the Chancellor or appropriate Dean.<sup id="R4"><a href="#F4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Service obligations</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of unclassified staff members to carry out
duties assigned by the department, and to share in the governance of the
 institution as a whole. Furthermore, it is also the duty of faculty
members to attend departmental, school or college, and university
faculty meetings.<sup id="R5"><a href="#F5">5</a></sup> Participation in outside professional activities must not impact these responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Disclosure requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Outside Activity Report</h4>
<p>Unclassified staff are required to complete an Outside Activity
Report that covers the previous year annually on or before April 30, and
 generally must update the report within 30 days if new outside
professional activities or financial interests are obtained after that
day. Details on what must be disclosed on an Outside Activity Report can
 be found at <a title="https://kb.wisc.edu/gsadminkb/page.php?id=33798" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://kb.wisc.edu/gsadminkb/page.php?id=33798">Frequently Asked Questions about Conflict of Interest</a>
 and should provide retroactive assessment of time commitments made in
the previous year. In addition, if an unclassified staff member
anticipates exceeding the time limits described above after the
effective date of this policy, the member should file an amended Outside
 Activity Report at least 20 days prior to beginning the time commitment
 to the outside professional activity and receive approval in advance of
 engaging in the outside professional activity from their Dean or
Director or their designee.</p>
<p>Unclassified staff seeking to engage or engaging in federally funded
or human subjects research must also be mindful of additional reporting
requirements found at <a title="https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=32879" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://research.wisc.edu/kb-article/?id=32879">Individual Financial Conflict of Interest: What to Report</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Notification of Potential Conflict of Commitment</h4>
<ol>
<li>Unclassified staff are required to notify their Dean or Director or
their designee by use of the Outside Activities Report if they
anticipate exceeding the time limits described above in order to receive
 approval in advance from the Dean or Director or their designee, who
will consult with the department chair or other supervisor and then
decide whether engagement in the outside professional activity will
disrupt performance of university duties, including teaching, research,
service, administrative responsibilities, and outreach.</li>
<li>Certain outside professional activities, such as applying for or
accepting grants or other funding in association with an outside entity
for research or scholarship or teaching a course or courses for another
college or university regardless of whether that course could be
conducted at UW-Madison must receive prior approval from the Dean or
Director or their designee, also regardless of any actual or anticipated
 time commitment.</li>
<li>Deans or Directors or their designees must respond to these
notifications in writing within 15 calendar days in one of three ways:
(1) by determining that there is no material conflict and the activity
can proceed; (2) by finding that further consultation is necessary prior
 to reaching a determination on whether the activity may proceed under
terms established by the institution; or (3) by determining there is a
conflict which must be resolved either by a change in university duties
or personal interests that result in the conflict.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Evaluation of Potential Conflicts of Commitment</h3>
<p>During the evaluation of potential conflicts of commitment, Deans or
Directors or their designees shall consult with the unclassified staff
member’s department chair or supervisor on whether conflicts disrupt or
interfere with university duties, including teaching, research, service,
 administrative responsibilities, and outreach.</p>
<p>Deans or Directors or their designees are responsible for making
decisions on whether or not the conflicts disrupt or interfere with
university duties and how to address potential conflicts of commitment
as needed.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Appeals</h3>
<p>Appeals should be advanced by the process described in <a title="/library/UW-808" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-808">Chapter 8 of the Faculty Policies and Procedures</a> or <a title="/library/UW-709" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-709">Chapter 9 of the Academic Staff Policies and Procedures</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Noncompliance</h3>
<p>Noncompliance with this policy may result in an investigation and
possible disciplinary action up to and including dismissal under <a title="/library/UW-809" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-809">Chapter 9 of the Faculty Policies and Procedures</a> or <a title="/library/UW-706" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210717200843/https://policy.wisc.edu/library/UW-706">Chapter 6 of the Academic Staff Policies and Procedures</a>.</p>
